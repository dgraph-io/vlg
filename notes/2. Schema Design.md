# Schema Design

Following the [raw data analysis](1. Raw Data Analysis.md), we can now start the process of designing a schema for the graph. But a good task to accomplish just prior to that is an analysis of all the ways users might want to query the graph.

## Queries (currently available on the ICIJ website)

### Text search across the graph
Currently, the ICIJ website allows users to enter terms that match nodes in entities, officers, intermediaries, others and addresses. For example, searching the term *New Hampshire* yields results in all five categories. Quotes can be used to restrict to exact phrases. The user can choose to narrow down the result listing by data type (entity, officer, etc.).

Further restriction of results to just one data set (Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, etc.) can be accomplished.

Similarly, restriction of the results to "Linked Countries" and "Registered Jurisdictions" can be accomplished.

### Selection of results
Clicking on a result record opens up a new page with details about the node in text form and a rendered graph (via Linkurious) which expands immediate edges. For example, an entity result page might have a rendered graph with all the officers, intermediaries and related addresses.

### Graphical interactions
In the graphical rendering, display nodes that have unrendered edges have a small numeric icon that indicates the number of hidden edges. Double-clicking on the node expands those edges (up to 10).

## New Queries
I propose that we support all queries that currently exist on the ICIJ website, and add new functionality as defined below.

### Text search with option for "full text/stemming"
In addition to term searching, let's allow fulltext searching as well. In the UI, perhaps this is a toggle or if the number of results is below a threshold, attempt to find more via 'fulltext' search.

### Search via address-resolved geolocation coordinates
I propose that we attempt to normalize addresses in the data sets using the AWS Location service. The service allows for free-form address text input and returns geo coordinates.  Constructing map views by querying this data should be straightforward.

### Path discovery
Given two or more entities, support "closest path" queries between them to allow researchers to discover non-obvious connections. Displaying this in a graphical rendering should be straightforward.

## Custom DQL
The final design of the GraphQL schema will concede that some custom DQL will have to be written to support lower-level, pure graph queries. As this is common in large production graphs, it will serve well as an example of best-practices.

## Future Additional Data
We may integrate other data sources into the VLG. Fortunately, Dgraph's schema flexibility allows the easy addition of potential predicates discovered in the future. However, we did review the following source schemas to ensure no schema conflicts would arise should those sources be integrated.

## Schema Location
The GraphQL Schema is located in the [schema](/schema) folder.
