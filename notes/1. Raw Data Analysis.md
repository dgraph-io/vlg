# Raw Data Analysis

The initial raw data originates from [The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Inc.](https://www.icij.org/) â€” "an independent global network of 280 investigative journalists and over 140 media organizations spanning more than 100 countries." [^1]. Our initial work here involves their "Offshore Leaks Database". The dataset is a collection of leaked financial documents that exposed links between people (some of them very well known) to offshore companies, foundations and trusts. Offshore and "shell" companies are commonly used by entities to hide wealth from public scrutiny.

### Data Acquisition
Unfortunately, the only known access to the raw data is via a link on the [offshore data page](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database). I've sent an email (sent Jan 17 2023) to the ICIJ technical team to see if they can provide more access via git or some other more stable technique.

Until then we'll charge ahead with an analysis of the data from [this](https://offshoreleaks-data.icij.org/offshoreleaks/csv/full-oldb.20221031.zip) file. Note, it's over 70MB zipped, so I'm choosing to not check it into git (at least for the time being). Ideally, it would be great to be able to submodule a raw data repo from ICIJ.

### Data Organization

The raw data is separated into CSV files:

* nodes-entities.csv - ~814,000 records; companies, trusts and foundations
* nodes-officers.csv - ~771,000 records; officers (people)
* nodes-intermediaries.csv - ~26,000 records; intermediaries (people or entities)
* nodes-addresses.csv - ~402,000 records; addresses
* nodes-others.csv - ~2,900 records; other entities
* relationships.csv - ~3.3M records; relationships between entities
