He also said that their client was introduced to them by one of the biggest Swiss banks to help with a potential real estate transaction in Spain. 'At a later stage, we discovered the client held 3 entities in Panama (set up by that same bank), and upon knowing that we recommended to dissolve such companies, paying any back taxes due. That is why we got in contact with the service provider just to have them disused.'   (Updated on Oct. 11th, 2016) (1x)

Mr. Marcel Benhamou, French citizen with address: 41, T. Tabidze Str. Apt 8, 0162, Tbilisi, Georgia is the ultimate beneficial owner of the company.” (Note updated on August 25th and November 29th, 2016 and visualization updated on November 8th and 29th, 2016). (1x)
